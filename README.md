Simple boilerplate for a device ui


# Some notes

## CSS framework

* I'll be using [picnic css](https://picnicss.com/). It seems pretty well suited for lightweight guis.

## Icons

* Icon fonts can be generated and downloaded from [Fontello](https://fontello.com/). This requires some work
(and I don't like that, I just want the computer do what I want. now.)
* For now it is much simpler to [use unicode fonts](https://unicode-table.com/)
